        The Christian Gospel is the good news that Christ brought. To summarize, it's The life of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior and His ministry.

        <br><i>This resource does not intend to replace the Bible, nor does it intend to add onto the bible. I suggest using one of the
        mainline bibles that have been known as trustworthy (ESV, NKJV, etc).</i>

    </button>
    <div class="content" style="height:250px;">
      <p class="desctext">
        Jesus is fully God, and fully human. Jesus is the second person of the trinity, and was born as a human from Mary.
        <br>
        <br>This is not the same as 50% god, and 50% human. To save us of our sins, Christ is 100% human, and 100% god.

      <h2>What did Jesus do?</h2>
    </button>
    <div class="content" style="height:250px;">
      <p class="desctext">
        Back in the old testimate, people had to sacrifice animals for each sin they did. Jesus fulfills this by being the ultimate sacrifice, paying for all of our sins as long as we believe in Jesus.
        <br>
        <br>Jesus Christ fulfilled this by dying on the cross, going to hell, and conquering death and ressurecting 3 days later. He showed himself to Mary, the 12 apostles, and then 500 more people (as accounted in the Gospels).
        <br>
        <br>If Jesus hadn't come down, we would all be condemmed to hell for eternity, or we would have to sacrifice an animal every year on the Israel temple, and if we couldn't, our sins wouldn't be forgiven. 
        However, since Jesus has risen from the dead, all of our sins have been forgiven in Christ.
        <br>
        <br>Jesus has done a lot more in his lifetime, like starting his own ministry (now the Christian Church), many many miracles, and a lot more. I implore you to read the 4 gospels for yourself, which are linked in our sources.

      <div class="content" style="height:250px;">
        <p class="desctext">
          If we don't believe in Christ, we would be condemmed to hell due to our sins (all of our sins condemn each of us to hell, no matter what). The bible says though, Christ is the only way to heaven.
          <br>
          <br>I don't want you to go to hell, and neither does God. I give you this message to help you find the right path in Christ.
          <br>
          <br>Very important! Faith without works is dead. Proclaiming to be Christian, without acting in a Christian way is not being Christian.

          "What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead." - James 2:14-17
